# Simple Image Processing Program
## Overview
This C project, "Simple Image Processing Program," is designed to perform basic image processing operations. It works primarily with PPM format images, allowing for tasks such as creating checkerboard patterns, image comparison, and general image manipulation.

## Features
- Creation of checkerboard pattern images.
- General image manipulation functions.
- Image comparison utilities.
- PPM image input/output operations.
- Streamlined compilation process with a `Makefile`.

## Files
- `checkerboard.c`: Generates checkerboard pattern images.
- `image_manip.c`/`image_manip.h`: Provide functions for image manipulation.
- `img_cmp.c`: Compares two images for similarity or differences.
- `ppm_io.c`/`ppm_io.h`: Handle reading and writing of PPM image files.
- `project.c`: Main program file that likely orchestrates image processing tasks.
- `Makefile`: Used to compile the program easily.

## Tech Stack
- C

## Libraries/Dependencies
- Standard C libraries.
